# React tutorial 
A guide (from basic to advance) on how to use react for building complex frontend applications .
React was created to solve the Ghost Message Problem or the Phantom Message Problem . This problem arose because even after the user read messages , the notifications showing no. of new messages was still there. Here the core problem was that the UI and DOM were not in sync. The pre-requisites to learn React are Javascript and DOM  knowledge.

There are two methods to learning it : 
1 Topic-wise : Babel, Fibre, Virtual DOM , Diffing Algorithm, Hydration, State or UI Manipulation, JSX (js+html) , Component reusability (Props), How to propogate change (hooks) 
Add-ons: React-router-dom, State-management tools -> redux, redux-tookit, zustand, Context API, use of BaaS apps like appwrite to build a full-stack production ready product.
2 Project-wise : Todo-app, calculator, Password-genertor

Framework vs Library
Framework is rigid but library is flexible. React is a JS library.
